# KnurldCE
Password-Manager CE for Knurld Hackathon


### Workflow

- Check if current website contains a login form
- Check if current user has already saved credentials for this url
- If yes, render button to allow user to authenticate using audio
- Process audio file using API to get markers for the audio (for different words)
- Post audio, user's Knurld details (generated by code, so user doesn't have to remember them) to Knurld
- Backend sends audio forward for authentication for given use
- Backend received token fron Knurld
- Chrome keeps polling till it gets token, then it authenticates it on it's own level
- If successful, replace fields with password and login
- If failed, goto step 3
- If user has not saved credentials for current site, record them when user logs in and enter to DB
- If user has not registered at all, train model, creating userID,etc. and then pass userID to Knurld server for registration
